R+AppVeyor [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xtc629xek00o5rui/branch/master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/krlmlr/r-appveyor/branch/master)
==========

This is a solution for continuous integration for R projects on Windows.
Inspired by [r-travis](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis),
but targeting [AppVeyor](http://appveyor.com) instead of [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org).
